# Machine Learning Operations - MLOPS 

This Page reveals tips you could use while deriving any AI project into real world. I will mostly talk about what things we should care about when we are working on various machine learning model phases such as : 

* AI problem formulations.
* Requirement understanding and setting up relevent metrics.
* Model Training and offline evalaution.
* Model profiling.
* Model in production.

#### Reference :

* I really like the way Chip Huyen has illustrated the different concepts in her book 'Designing Machine Learning Systems'. Most of the concepts has been cherry picked from this book , along with my personal experience.
