# Machine Learning Operations - MLOPS 

This Page reveals tips you could use while deriving any AI project into real world. I will mostly talk about what things we should care about when we are working on various machine learning model phases such as : 

* AI problem formulations.
* Requirement understanding and setting up relevent metrics.
* Model Training and offline evalaution.
* Model profiling.
* Model in production.
