## Warning Part 1: Your site is now visible to the entire Internet

GitHub Pages is a publishing medium. Enabling GitHub Pages on your repo means anyone with the [GitHub Pages URL to your site](github-pages-url.md)
can view it.

## Warning Part 2: You can create public sites from private repos

GitHub allows you to create private repositories. But nothing is stopping you from enabling GitHub Pages on your private repo.
Be warned that if you do so, people will be able to view GitHub Pages version of your repo.
