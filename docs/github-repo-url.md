# The GitHub repository URL is always https://github.com/{userid}/{reponame}

GitHub repositories all use the same naming convention, which is `https://github.com/{userid}/{reponame}`:

* Starting with with the Github URL followed by a `/` slash:

```
https://github.com/
```

* Followed by your GitHub username/account name, then by a `/` slash. The creator of this repo has the GitHub username `tomcam`, for example, so you'd have:

```
https://github.com/tomcam/
```

* Followed by the name of the repo, in this case `least-github-pages`.  The completed URL would be:

```
https://github.com/tomcam/least-github-pages
```

## Example repo URLs

* The name of the Microsoft Visual Studio Code repository is https://github.com/microsoft/vscode
* The name of the Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework repository is https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap
* The name of the https://FreeCodeCamp.org repo is https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp

The reason to beat you over the head with this is that your published website will follow its own URL naming convention, and it's easy to derive one from the other.
