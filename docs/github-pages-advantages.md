# Advantages to using GitHub Pages to generate static sites

GitHub Pages is ideally suited for the creation of small-to-medium informational sites, 
especially technical documentation and other how-to subjects.

* Nothing to install, and no files to store on your own machine. This guide shows you how to create your web pages interactively on the [GitHub](https://github.com) website. You can literally start a page on your work machine, update it using your phone on the bus,
and finish it on your home machine
* It's free* (for public sites)
* It's based on Markdown (sometimes called markup) a simple approach to writing that emphasizes the text itself, with minimal
attention to formatting. It transforms simple text files into beautiful websites. You write the text files using a simple, 
natural set of conventions similar to the way many people format email. But
because it centers around text files, you can easily pick them up and move them to a different
content management system if don't like GitHub Pages
* You can use it as the source for other hosting services, such as [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is built on top of Git and GitHub, a powerful version control combination.
Version control lets you roll back to earlier versions of a page (or the whole site)
if you make a mistake somewhere
* Because it's based on GitHub, GitHub Pages automatically has a bug/feature reporting system called Issues that's available to every publication you create. Collaboration is built into every GitHub pages you create with no exta effort from you
* GitHub offers a clear, easy-to-read preview of Markdown pages 
That means even if you don't use GitHub Pages for the final output, you can quickly see a rough idea of the 
finished page and make edits to it instantly, with automatic version control
* Because of the GitHub integration it's ideal for teams
* It's web-based, so you can start a page at home, then pick it up later a work without having to 
install any software or copy files manually
* It's ideally suited for simple read-only blogs where absolute control over formatting isn't as important
as getting information across

\* GitHub can almost certainly handle your needs, but isn't designed for [exceptionally popular commercial sites](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/what-is-my-disk-quota)
