# Add GitHub Pages preview link to your README.md

It helps to have a link like this near the top of the document so your audience can view either the
themed GitHub Pages version or the GitHub repo preview:

```
View in [Github Pages](https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/) or directly on [Github](https://github.com/tomcam/least-github-pages/) 
* [Your GitHub Pages URL and adding preview to your README.md](add-github-pages-preview.md)
```

## It can take a few moments to generate the current GitHub Pages site

GitHub Pages doesn't generate your new website every time you make changes to a repo. It updates "lazily", meaning
that it won't render the full Jekyll version of the site until someone actually browses to the GitHub Pages URL. 
It can take up several minutes for your GitHub Pages site to be generated after you add pages or made changes to existing ones.
