## Intended audience

GitHub Pages uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a publishing system based on the Ruby programming language. The Jekyll documentation is excellent, especially if you already know Jekyll, program in Ruby, and have both Ruby and Jekyll installed on your local computer. The GitHub Pages documentation is comprehensive and excellent--if you're already a Jekyll expert.

[The Least You Need to Know About GitHub Pages](./) is designed for people who don't happen to know Jekyll already but who need to get up to speed in GitHub Pages quickly to get a job done *now*. It tells you not only *what* to do step by step,
but also briefly explains *why* you're doing it.

You probably don't want to use GitHub Pages on sites that require complex, individual formatting on a per-page basis. 
GitHub Pages uses Markdown, which has some limited formatting information but not a lot.
GitHub Pages then uses Jekyll to turn that Markdown into HTML, based on the Jekyll theme you've chosen. Generally speaking this approach is
absolutely ideal for blogs, technical documents and instructional materials that require versioning and collaboration, where the
main work product is words and pictures. It is not a good fit for things like boutique pages, restaurant menu sites, consumer product sites, and so on where
custom formatting is the norm.
