# Demestifying Graph Neural Network

This page is helping guide for understanding graph neural netowrk terminolgies, formulation into graph problems.


Recommended books : 

1. Graph neural networks by Lingfei Wu, Peng cui, Jian Pei, Liang Zhao. 
       In my journey of Graph neural network, i read this book, I put my notes here for each chapter. [Graph neural networks](./Graph-neural-networks-by-Lingfei-Wu.md)
