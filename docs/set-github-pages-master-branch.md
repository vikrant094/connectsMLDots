## Setting the GitHub Pages master branch to /docs folder 

GitHub Pages and Jekyll prefer you to use a directory structure 
starting not in the root directory but in `/docs`. Inserting `/docs`
before in a path can get old. GitHub lets you avoid this by establishing it
as the base directory for your documentation site.

* From the list of sections on the middle of the page choose **Settings**:

![Choose the Settings tab](./assets/github-settings-tab.png)

* Find the section named **GitHub Pages**, and choose  **Source**.

* Choose **master branch /docs folder**.

Changing the master branch to `/docs` means you will be able to avoid 
specifying the `/docs` folder at the base of every link in the README directory.
